# Stochastic Modeling and UQ Final Project
Final project on MFCE for rare-event estimation for UQ class.

Authors: Frederick Law and Terrence Alsup

## Description of the code.
The main Matlab files are:

1. CrossEntropy.m
2. MFCE.m
3. CE_LogNormal.m
4. MFCE_LogNormal.m

Files 1. and 2. implement CE and MFCE with a family of Gaussian biasing densities.
Files 3. and 4. implement CE and MFCE with a family of Log-normal biasing densities.
To see how to run the code check the documentation of these files.

Several additional Matlab scripts are included for some test cases.
